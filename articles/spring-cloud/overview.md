# What is Azure Spring Cloud?

Azure Spring Cloud makes it easy to deploy Spring Boot microservice applications to Azure without any code changes.  The service manages the infrastructure of Spring Cloud applications so developers can focus on their code.  Azure Spring Cloud provides lifecycle management using comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, configuration management, service discovery, CI/CD integration, blue-green deployments, and more.

The following video shows an app composed of Spring Boot applications running on Azure using Azure Spring Cloud.

## Why use Azure Spring Cloud?

Deployment of applications to Azure Spring Cloud has many benefits. You can:

* Efficiently migrate existing Spring apps and manage cloud scaling and costs.
* Modernize apps with Spring Cloud patterns to improve agility and speed of delivery.
* Run Java at cloud scale and drive higher usage without complicated infrastructure.
* Develop and deploy rapidly without containerization dependencies.
* Monitor production workloads efficiently and effortlessly.

Azure Spring Cloud supports both Java [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and ASP.NET Core [Steeltoe](https://steeltoe.io/) apps. Steeltoe support is currently offered as a public preview. Public preview offerings let you experiment with new features prior to their official release.

## Service overview

As part of the Azure ecosystem, Azure Spring Cloud allows easy binding to other Azure services including storage, databases, monitoring, and more.

* Azure Spring Cloud is a fully managed service for Spring Boot apps that lets you focus on building and running apps without the hassle of managing infrastructure.

* Simply deploy your JARs or code for your Spring Boot app or Zip for your Steeltoe app, and Azure Spring Cloud will automatically wire your apps with Spring service runtime and built-in app lifecycle.

* Monitoring is simple. After deployment you can monitor app performance, fix errors, and rapidly improve applications.

* Full integration to Azure's ecosystems and services.

* Azure Spring Cloud is enterprise ready with fully managed infrastructure, built-in lifecycle management, and ease of monitoring.

## Enterprise Tier Overview
Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise Tier (preview) is optimized for the needs of enterprise Spring developers through advanced configurability, flexibility, portability, and enterprise-ready VMware Spring Runtime 24x7 support. Developers also benefit from proprietary Tanzu components such as Tanzu Build Service and Spring Cloud Gateway, and access to Spring experts. Via this new Tier offering, you can secure below benefits:
* All features available in Azure Spring Cloud standard tier are also offered in enterprise tier with same enterprise grade quality and we will promisingly keep this **feature parity with standard tie**r as a product principle in future.
* 24x7 **VMware Spring Runtime support**, access to Spring experts and ability to open support tickets while utilizing Spring libraries with extended commercial support period.
* **Commercial Tanzu product**s as managed services:
   * **Build Service**: helps you develop and automate containerized software workflows securely and at scale on top of commercial Tanzu buildpacks.
   * **Service Registry**: a highly available service registry for your services to dynamically discover and call other services.
   * **Application Configuration Service**: provides centralized configuration with Git integration.
   * **Spring Cloud Gateway**: based on the open source Spring Cloud Gateway project, it handles cross-cutting concerns on behalf of API development teams, such as: Single Sign-On (SSO), access control, rate limiting, resiliency, security, and more. It offers plenty of commercial-only features on top of those open source underpinnings including Simple Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration combined with commercial API route filters to enable authentication and access control, Dynamic API route configuration, etc. 
   * **API Portal**: enable developers to conveniently browse internal and external APIs through a simple interface.
* **Portability and flexibility** in workload management:
   * Tanzu product on demand: you decide which Tanzu products to use for your enterprise tier instance based on your actual need. 
   * Build service can be customized in ways of creating / configuring builders with Tanzu exclusively provided APM integrations (Dynatrace, New Relic, AppDynamics, etc.) and configuring how much dedicated resources will be allocated to run build tasks. 
   * Zero code change to land your workloads into Azure Spring Cloud enterprise tier.

## Documentation overview

This documentation includes sections that explain how to get started and leverage Azure Spring Cloud services.

* Get started

    * [Launch your first app](./quickstart.md)
    * [Provision an Azure Spring Cloud service](./quickstart-provision-service-instance.md)
    * [Set up the configuration server]()
    * [Build and deploy apps](./quickstart-deploy-apps.md)
    * [Use logs metrics and tracing](./quickstart-logs-metrics-tracing.md)

* How-to

    * [Develop](how-to-prepare-app-deployment.md): Prepare an existing Java Spring application for deployment to Azure Spring Cloud. When configured properly, Azure Spring Cloud provides robust services to monitor, scale, and update Java Spring Cloud applications.
    * [Deploy](./how-to-staging-environment.md): How to set up a staging deployment by using the blue-green deployment pattern in Azure Spring Cloud. Blue/green deployment is an Azure DevOps Continuous Delivery pattern that relies on keeping an existing (blue) version live, while a new (green) one is deployed.
    * [Configure apps](./how-to-start-stop-delete.md):  Start, stop, and delete your application in Azure Spring Cloud. Change an application's state in Azure Spring Cloud by using either the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.
    * [Scale](./how-to-scale-manual.md): Scale any microservice application using the Azure Spring Cloud dashboard in the Azure portal or using autoscale settings. Public IPs are available to communicate with external resources, such as databases, storage, and key vaults.
    * [Monitor apps](./how-to-distributed-tracing.md): Distributed tracing tools to easily debug and monitor complex issues. Azure Spring Cloud integrates Spring Cloud Sleuth with Azure's Application Insights. This integration provides powerful distributed tracing capability from the Azure portal.
    * [Secure apps](./how-to-enable-system-assigned-managed-identity.md): Azure resources provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code.
    * [Integration with other Azure services](./how-to-bind-cosmos.md): Instead of manually configuring your Spring Boot applications, you can automatically bind selected Azure services to your applications, for example, binding your application to an Azure Cosmos DB database.
    * [Automate](./how-to-cicd.md): Continuous integration and continuous delivery tools let you quickly deploy updates to existing applications with minimal effort and risk. Azure DevOps helps organize and control these key tasks.
    * [Troubleshoot](./how-to-self-diagnose-solve.md): Azure Spring Cloud diagnostics provide an interactive experience to help troubleshoot apps. No configuration is required. When you find issues, Azure Spring Cloud diagnostics identifies problems and guides you to information that helps troubleshoot and resolve issues.
    * [Migrate](/azure/developer/java/migration/migrate-spring-boot-to-azure-spring-cloud): How to migrate an existing Spring Cloud application or Spring Boot application to run on Azure Spring Cloud.
